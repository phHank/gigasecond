# Gigasecond

My solution to Exercism's Gigasecond problem on the JavaScript track: 

Given a moment, determine the moment that would be after a gigasecond
has passed.

A gigasecond is 10^9 (1,000,000,000) seconds.

## Testing the code. 

- example input: `const moment = new Date(Date.UTC(2020, 0, 4, 20, 28, 30))`

- `console.log(gigigasecond(moment))`
